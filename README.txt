## Inspiration: I got this inspiration from my own experience, I have recently given my 6th-semester engineering exam while my exam days we have created group for exam preparation  to help others, but we all are busy on their preparation, we couldn't able to responds to the queries of group member's, even for my queries also same,so I came up with an Idea called "Campus Buddy"

## what it does": Here to assist/help you, He will be your best buddy to give information about your exam schedules, exam results, syllabus, hostel/Campus issues, campus updates too.

## How we built it:

This is the interesting part, We have built it with wit.AI,Node.js, Fb Messenger API. we understood the adaptive intelligence of wit.AI, we train the bot by implementing bit basics concepts of NLP Like POS, Entities, Data/Word Structures, Intent processing.

## Challenges we ran into:

The Challenge we were facing is adapting to students nature, Yes! we built this bot to get adapt to the nature of users, bot will get trained on the words/slang or terminologies they use for conversation. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of:

we got the Solution/Result for our problem- yes! I can receive my results/syllabus by just sending my information to my bot in just a couple of taps:
"Result, buddy?"
Yeah!  I got my exam results!!!

## What we learned: 

How to Build a BOT by integrating with FB messenger, Yeah! we are excited "Campus Buddy" is First Bot For us.

## What's next for Campus Buddy:

Campus Buddy in future will be a smarter by providing information like Campus(Map) navigation, Apply for Higher studies/Events, Results with your percentage, any updates in university website will reflect as notification.
